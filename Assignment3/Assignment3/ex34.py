# Study Drills
# 1. With what you know of the difference between these types of numbers, can you explain why the year 2010 in "January 1, 2010," really is 2010 and not 2009?
# This is an odd question. Because it is in a string and not used as an array index?

# 2. Write some more lists and work out similar indexes until you can translate them.
boringlist = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']

# The item at index 0 should be 'one'
# The item at index 3 should be 'four'

# 3.
print("The first item in the list is: ", boringlist[0])
print("The last item in the list is: ", boringlist[3])
