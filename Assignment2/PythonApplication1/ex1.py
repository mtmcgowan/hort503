# Study Drills
# 1. Make your script print another line.
print("Another line")

# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
# This is done by commenting out all but one function call, or:
print("only one of the lines....")

# 3. Put a # character at the beginning of the line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does.
# Well this seems awkward.....It comments out following text, which isn't read by the compiler.
